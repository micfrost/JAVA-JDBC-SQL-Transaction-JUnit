# Java JDBC Transaction Management with Rollbacks

## Project Description
This project demonstrates transaction management in Java using JDBC, focusing on rollbacks within a PostgreSQL database. It serves as an educational resource for understanding advanced database operations in Java.

## Features
- **Conditional Rollbacks**: Implements rollbacks based on specific conditions, like insufficient record insertion.
- **Database Operations**: Manages operations like table creation and data insertion.
- **Transaction Lifecycle Management**: Controls database transactions, including commit and rollback.
- **JUnit Testing**: Includes tests to verify transactional behavior, especially rollbacks.

## Java Features
- Utilizes JDBC for database connectivity and transaction management.
- Employs Java Exception Handling for robust error management.
- Implements Java Collections (e.g., ArrayList) for data handling.
- Follows Java best practices for class and method design.

## Requirements
- Java JDK
- PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
- JUnit for testing

## Usage
- Execute `MainApp` for a demonstration.
- Run `TransactionTest` to validate transaction mechanisms.
