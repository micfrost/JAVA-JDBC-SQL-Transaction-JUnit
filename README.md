# Java JDBC Transaction Management with Rollbacks

## Project Description
This project demonstrates transaction management in Java using JDBC, focusing on rollbacks within a PostgreSQL database. It serves as an educational resource for understanding advanced database operations in Java.

## Features
- **Conditional Rollbacks**: Implements rollbacks based on specific conditions, like insufficient record insertion.
- **Database Operations**: Manages operations like table creation and data insertion.
- **Transaction Lifecycle Management**: Controls database transactions, including commit and rollback.
- **JUnit Testing**: Includes tests to verify transactional behavior, especially rollbacks.

## Java Features
- **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**: Utilizes JDBC for establishing and managing database connections, executing SQL statements, and handling result sets.
- **Exception Handling**: Employs Java's exception handling mechanisms to manage SQLExceptions, ensuring the system's robustness and resilience to errors.
- **Control over Transaction Boundaries**: Manages transactions through explicit control of commit and rollback operations, demonstrating the handling of transaction boundaries.
- **JUnit Framework**: Uses the JUnit framework for writing and running repeatable tests, providing a thorough validation mechanism for the applicationâ€™s functionality.


## Requirements
- Java JDK
- PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
- JUnit for testing

## Usage
- Execute `MainApp` for a demonstration.
- Run `TransactionTest` to validate transaction mechanisms.
