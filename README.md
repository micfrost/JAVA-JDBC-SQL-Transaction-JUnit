# Java JDBC Transaction Management with Rollbacks

## Project Description
This project demonstrates transaction management in Java using JDBC, focusing on rollbacks within a PostgreSQL database. It serves as an educational resource for understanding advanced database operations in Java.

## Key Features
- **Conditional Rollbacks**: Implements rollbacks based on specific conditions, like insufficient record insertion.
- **Database Operations**: Manages operations like table creation and data insertion.
- **Transaction Lifecycle Management**: Controls database transactions, including commit and rollback.
- **JUnit Testing**: Includes tests to verify transactional behavior, especially rollbacks.

## Components
- `Transaction`: Manages transactions.
- `DataManagement`: Handles database operations.
- `DBConnection`: Manages PostgreSQL database connections.
- `TransactionTest`: Provides JUnit tests.

## Requirements
- Java JDK
- PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
- JUnit for testing

## Usage
- Execute `MainApp` for a demonstration.
- Run `TransactionTest` to validate transaction mechanisms.

## Ideal For
Developers and learners interested in transaction management and ensuring data integrity in Java applications.
